							<h2>About</h2>
						</header>
						<div class="content">
							<p><strong>Aleena Mansur Shaikh</strong> is born in October 2010. This child prodigy started her riding stint in 2018, and as her father distinctly remembers it was almost end of March when this sojourn began. No one in the family has ever participated in Motocross or Supercross events. It all began with Mr. Mansur Shaikh taking his little princess on rides after he got his superbike. She loved the thrill of throwing caution to the winds. She started with a 50CC Chinese bike through which she learnt the basic balance of biking and as this talent comes so naturally to Aleena, in just a month's time she was able to scale up to a Kawasaki KLX - 110CC bike. It has been less than a year as of today that Aleena has been riding and she already aspires to participate in the Dakar Rally.</p>
							<p>MR. Mansur Shaikh has a very clear view about his daughter and her love for motorsport - "Whatever she is determined to do, she has my support always. We are lucky to have family and friends ably backing us up. What she currently lacks is a sponsor's support. This will bolster her preparations and will never let finances/resources to become a show stopper. This step is critical as it can decide the future of a budding motorsport star that my daughter has set out to be."</p>

							<p>While conversing with Aleena what stands out is that she is passionate about riding and is raring to take high jumps. She is keen to practice more and has her eyes set on  becoming a PRO Rider by the early age of 14 or 16.</p>
							<p><strong>She says</strong> - <br>Jumps, whoops, turns, dirt, motorcycles, they are all a melange of one glorious motorsport and makes me come alive. I love watching my fears and apprehensions vanish when I hop on to a bike.</p>
							<p>During this year Aleena wants to participate in <a href="http://www.godspeedracing.in">MRF and GODSPEED Racing</a>. Her coach and technical engineer Mohsin Pasha and Mujeeb Pasha are working constantly with Aleena to make her ready for the challenges she is aspiring to take on.</p>

							<h2>Inspiration</h2>
						</header>
						<div class="content">
							<p><strong>At Pune Supercross</strong> when she was asked what inspired her, with an angel like smile on her face Aleena pointed at her father and said - "I never realized when I asked Papa to ride faster, what actually I wanted was to talk to the  wind while on a bike. Papa helped me transform my wishes into an aspiration that I can achieve."</p>
